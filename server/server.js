// 2 Now we want to point this app to our public folder

// Normal URL is http://localhost:5000/
// To use GET request: http://localhost:5000/quotes

// when this function gets called at this endpoint we need 2 things: 1. console.log 2. Response
console.log('Request for /quotes was made');

// send back the list of quotes
// We can see in our brower
res.send(quoteList); // We can only send 1 response per request, anything after res.send will not work

//respond with status code
// res.sendStatus(200);

//Respond with status code & a thing
// res.send(400).send('this request is broken'); ---> this is just to show that it doesn't work

}) ;// in this function we have a request to GET quotes List array and we then get a response of server sending back the quote list

// 11 Route for POST request 
app.post('/', (req, res) => {
console.log('Does this work POST ðŸ¥¸');

// this is grabbing a new quote from the request body
// The request body is the data that is sent from the client 
    let incomingText = req.body.text  // (how we access data) the last part .text comes from PostMan (whatever we title in POSTMAN under body under key will go here ) we have text in key box on PostMan
    let incomingAuthor = req.body.author //(how we access data) the last part .author comes from PostMan (whatever we title in POSTMAN under body under key will go here ) we have author in key box on PostMan

console.log('Incoming quote to add', incomingText); // to see if let quote = req.body.text is working
console.log('Incoming author to add', incomingAuthor); // to see if let author = req.body.author is working

//this is a new quote object
// which will be pushed to the quotesList array

    text: incomingText,
    author: incomingAuthor
};

console.log('All quotes:' , quoteList)


    res.sendStatus(201);
})




// 6. After this function is written.. restart server in terminal with ctrl C and refresh browser with localhost:5000/quotes <---- this text would change depending on what we are GET

// 3 Now we give code to start our server
// arrow function ()=> will write and execute a function in the same place 
app.listen(port, () => {
